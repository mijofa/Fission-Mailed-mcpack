* Apply this to Crossbows, Shields, and Fishing Rods.
  Maybe also Pumpkins?
* Fix Bows (& presumably crossbows/etc) for Bedrock edition

* Somehow make the bedrock version of the resource pack buildable from this repo
* This happens for damn near every file in the bedrock resource pack, resolve it:
  > [WARN]: [Geyser-Spigot] The resource pack Fission-Mailed.mcpack has a file in it that meets or exceeds 80 characters in its path (attachables/geyser_custom/minecraft/item/pickaxes/wooden_pickaxe/0b1011100000000.gmdl_c40bc0e.attachable.json, 109 characters long). This will cause problems on some Bedrock platforms. Please rename it to be shorter, or reduce the amount of folders needed to get to the file.
