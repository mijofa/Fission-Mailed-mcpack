Mostly combining a few packs:
* `Minimal Armour <https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/minimal-armor/>`_
* `Armoured Elytra <https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/armoured-elytra-resource-pack-for-vanillatweaks-datapack/>`_
* `Prosperity Resource Pack <https://github.com/ProsperityMC/Prosperity-Resource-Pack>`_ (Totems only) FIXME: I'd like the hats/pumpkins, but it wasn't working without Optifine

Along with some hacks to allow me to flex some `Visual Enchantments
<https://github.com/CiscuLog/Visual-Enchantments>`_ using CustomModelData
without making other players/friends install Optifine/CITResewn

I'd love to include a datapack that somehow automatically adds the
CustomModelData according to the enchants on the item, even if only after
dropping the item on a smithing table or something.
I don't really know what I'm doing with making my own datapacks though,
and what I have investigated they don't seem very server resource efficient.
