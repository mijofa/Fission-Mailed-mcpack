Mostly combining a few packs:

* `Armoured Elytra <https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/armoured-elytra-resource-pack-for-vanillatweaks-datapack/>`_
* `Minimal Armour <https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/hoffens-minimal-armor>`_
* `Prosperity Resource Pack <https://github.com/ProsperityMC/Prosperity-Resource-Pack>`_ (Totems only)
  FIXME: I'd like the hats/pumpkins, but it wasn't working without Optifine
* `Fancy Beds <https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/fancy-beds>`_

Along with some hacks to allow me to flex some `Visual Enchantments <https://github.com/CiscuLog/Visual-Enchantments>`_ using CustomModelData without making other players/friends install Optifine/CITResewn

You can apply these textures using the `Custom Roleplay Data <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/custom-roleplay-data-datapack>`_ datapack (installed on Fission Mailed server) by holding the associated item in your main hand, then putting ``/trigger CustomModelData set <ID>`` with the custom model ID in the chat
.. FIXME: That datapack is simple enough and could be even simpler, combine it into this repo's datapack?

Custom totems
-------------

The server/world datapack changes the Evoker loot table so that you have an equal chance of getting any 1 of them.

Except the player/user specific ones at the end of the table,
since they're really only meant for the user they are made to look like.
